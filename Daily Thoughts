- I decided to go back and refresh again on Binary
- Since I was not able to get my benchmark to work during class I worked on it after class, was not able to get it to work :( ...got it to work today though :)
- Decided I wanted to practice everyday we have our week off; I want to go back to basics and work my way back; Looking forward to going over arrays again :)
- I had gotten frustrated with the Bejeweled Project (Challenge) so I may go back to that during the break :)
