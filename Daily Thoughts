- I decided to go back and refresh again on Binary
- Since I was not able to get my benchmark to work during class I worked on it after class, was not able to get it to work :( ...got it to work today though :)
- Decided I wanted to practice everyday we have our week off; I want to go back to basics and work my way back; Looking forward to going over arrays again :)
- I had gotten frustrated with the Bejeweled Project (Challenge) so I may go back to that during the break :)

-I admit I fell behind on this. Had a family member pass on Thanksgiving Day so I did fall behind
-I did code and practice but can't remember the days so I am starting over fresh now
-Today I worked on my Greenlit to Graduation and will complete it today
-I plan to look at and work on the assessment but span it out through the weekend
